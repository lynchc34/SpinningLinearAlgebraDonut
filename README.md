# Spinning Linear Algebra Donut

Preface: This is in no way an original idea, the code is based heavily on the article by [Andy Sloane](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html). 

Its a pretty cool piece of code which he originally did in C. 


I decided to try and convert the code from C to python to cement my python syntax and also brush up on my linear algebra. 

Can't say that I possibly wasn't (*very*) influenced my Joma Tech's [vide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI&ab_channel=JomaTech) <- This also really helped my understanding of the logic behind the illustration&rendering of the donut itself  ~~maths articles only go so far...
